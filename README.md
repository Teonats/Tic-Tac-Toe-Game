The name of the project is TIC TAC TOE, In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.
The goal of Tic Tac Toe game is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game. The game can be played by two players. 


I created Paleyer X and Player O, The player that gets to play first will get the "X" and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" .
X player and O player taking a turnes during the game. 


One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
